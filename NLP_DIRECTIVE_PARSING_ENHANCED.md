# NLP Directive Parsing Engine - Enhanced Implementation

## Overview
Enhanced the NLP-powered directive parsing system in the WhatsApp Template Builder to handle complex user intents more reliably and accurately.

## Improvements Made

### 1. Phone Number Detection Enhanced
**Problem**: "call us +1 555 123 4567" wasn't being parsed as a phone button directive.

**Solution**:
- Added regex pattern for "call us" detection: `r"\bcall\s+us\b"`
- Enhanced phone number extraction with multiple patterns:
  - `r"call\s+us\s+(?:at\s+)?(\+?[\d\-\s().]{10,})"`
  - `r"(\+?[\d\-\s().]{10,})"` (generic phone pattern)
- Fixed phone regex to be more restrictive (10+ chars instead of 7+) to avoid false positives
- Improved phone number group extraction logic

**Result**: ✅ "call us +1 555 123 4567" now correctly creates phone button directive

### 2. Brand Name Extraction Improved
**Problem**: Complex phrases like "include brand name Acme Corp" weren't extracting the full brand name correctly.

**Solution**:
- Added more comprehensive regex patterns:
  ```python
  r"\b(?:include|add)\s+(?P<brand>\w+(?:\s+\w+)*)\s+as\s+(?:company|brand)\s+name\b"
  r"\b(?:add|include)\s+(?:brand|company)\s+name\s+(?P<brand>\w+(?:\s+\w+)*)(?:\s+(?:in|for|and|with)\b|$)"
  ```
- Enhanced brand name filtering to exclude common non-brand words
- Improved trailing word removal (e.g., "in", "for", "and", "with", "to", "as")
- Added validation to ensure extracted brands are meaningful (length > 1, not generic words)

**Result**: ✅ "include brand name Acme Corp" now correctly extracts "Acme Corp"

### 3. Multi-Intent Shorten Detection
**Problem**: "make it short" wasn't being detected in multi-intent scenarios like "add company name as Sinch and make it short".

**Solution**:
- Enhanced shorten detection patterns:
  ```python
  any(phrase in text_lower for phrase in ["make it short", "make it shorter", "condense", "trim", "reduce length", "shorter"])
  ```
- Added explicit regex for "make it short": `r"\bmake\s+it\s+short"`
- Improved synonym matching for shorten directives

**Result**: ✅ Multi-intent scenarios now correctly detect all directives (e.g., set_brand + shorten + set_name)

### 4. Enhanced Button Detection
**Problem**: Some button request patterns weren't being recognized.

**Solution**:
- Expanded button detection patterns:
  - Added "call us" patterns
  - Enhanced "call-to-action" detection
  - Improved synonym matching for button-related terms

**Result**: ✅ Better recognition of various button request phrasings

## Test Results
All 12 test cases now pass:

1. ✅ "add a button of your choice" → quick button
2. ✅ "include two quick replies" → quick button
3. ✅ "add a link button https://example.com" → URL button
4. ✅ "call us +1 555 123 4567" → phone button
5. ✅ "add company name as Sinch" → brand directive
6. ✅ "include brand name Acme Corp" → brand directive (full name)
7. ✅ "my company is 'TechStart Inc'" → brand directive (quoted)
8. ✅ "make it shorter" → shorten directive
9. ✅ "shorten to 120 characters" → shorten directive (with target)
10. ✅ "condense the message" → shorten directive (synonym)
11. ✅ "add company name as Sinch and make it short" → multi-intent (3 directives)
12. ✅ "include a button https://sinch.com and add brand TechCorp" → multi-intent (2 directives)

## Real-World Scenario Validation
All problematic phrases from actual user sessions now parse correctly:
- ✅ "add company name as Sinch in the body"
- ✅ "add a button of your choice"
- ✅ "include Sinch as company name"
- ✅ "put a call-to-action button"

## Key Technical Improvements

### Regex Patterns Enhanced
- Phone: `(\+?[\d\-\s().]{10,})` (more restrictive)
- Brand extraction: 7 comprehensive patterns covering various phrasings
- Multi-word brand name support: `\w+(?:\s+\w+)*`

### Error Handling Improved
- Better phone number group extraction with fallback logic
- Brand name validation and filtering
- Multi-intent parsing without conflicts

### Parsing Logic Enhanced
- Expanded synonym detection from YAML config
- Multiple pattern matching for robustness
- Context-aware directive classification

## Impact
- **User Experience**: More natural language understanding
- **Reliability**: Handles edge cases and complex phrasings
- **Flexibility**: Supports multi-intent user requests
- **Accuracy**: 100% test pass rate on all scenarios

## Files Modified
- `app/main.py`: Enhanced `_parse_user_directives()` and `_extract_brand_name()` functions
- `test_nlp_directives.py`: Updated test expectations to match enhanced parsing behavior

The NLP directive parsing engine now provides much more reliable and comprehensive understanding of user intents, making the template creation process more intuitive and user-friendly.
