# Context and Friendly Chat Fixes

## Issues Addressed

### 1. Lost Friendly Chat
**Problem**: System was adding forced encouragement on every turn, making it feel robotic and overwhelming.

**Solution**: 
- Reduced encouragement frequency from "every turn with extras" to only 30% chance at milestone moments
- Added more conditions: only after 4+ turns, when user made progress, not after confirmations, and only for short replies
- Removed deterministic encouragement injection

### 2. Missing Context  
**Problem**: Button modifications weren't properly handled - system wasn't respecting user requests to replace buttons.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced directive parsing to detect "one button" patterns more reliably
- Fixed button replacement logic to properly clear existing buttons when user says "only one button"
- Improved button text extraction for modification requests
- Added proper count handling to force count=1 when user explicitly asks for "only one"

### 3. Too Much Deterministic Behavior
**Problem**: System was overriding LLM responses too aggressively, blocking natural conversation flow.

**Solution**:
- Removed deterministic overrides that were replacing LLM responses with templated messages
- Only override LLM when response is completely missing or extremely short (< 15 chars)
- Let LLM handle natural conversation flow instead of forcing predetermined responses
- Removed forced button/header/footer confirmations that were blocking context

## Key Changes Made

### Button Directive Enhancement
```python
# Now detects "one button" patterns more reliably
button_modify_indicators = any(phrase in text_lower for phrase in [
    "modify the button", "change the button", "replace button", "update button",
    "modify button", "change button", "button should be", "make the button",
    "i need only one button", "only one button", "just one button", "one button"
])

# Force count to 1 when user explicitly asks for "only one"
if any(phrase in text_lower for phrase in ["only one button", "just one button", "one button"]):
    count = 1
```

### Improved Button Application Logic
```python
# Apply count limit if specified
if count > 0:
    qrs = qrs[:count]

# Apply count limit after capping if specified  
if count > 0:
    buttons = buttons[:count]
```

### Reduced Encouragement Frequency
```python
# Add encouragement sparingly - only at key milestones and when appropriate
should_encourage = (
    len(msgs) > 4 and  # After several turns
    any(extras_present.values()) and  # When user has made progress
    not msgs_applied and  # Not when we have directive feedback
    len(final_reply) < 80 and  # Short replies only
    not _is_affirmation(safe_message) and  # Not after confirmations
    random.random() < 0.3  # Only 30% chance to avoid overwhelming
)
```

### Removed Deterministic Overrides
- Removed automatic replacement of LLM responses with "Added quick replies" messages
- Removed forced header/footer confirmation messages
- Let LLM handle conversation flow naturally

## Test Cases Verified

### Button Replacement
- Input: "i need only one button Get Now"
- Expected: Replace all existing buttons with single "Get Now" button
- Result: ✅ Working correctly

### Encouragement Frequency  
- Previous: Added on every turn with extras present
- New: Only 30% chance at milestone moments
- Result: ✅ Much less overwhelming

### Context Preservation
- Previous: Lost user's specific button modification requests
- New: Properly handles "modify the button to X" and "only one button X"
- Result: ✅ Context maintained and respected

## Benefits

1. **More Natural Conversation**: LLM can respond naturally without being overridden
2. **Better Context Handling**: User requests for button modifications are properly understood and executed
3. **Less Overwhelming**: Encouragement messages are much more sparing and contextual
4. **Improved User Experience**: System respects user intent instead of forcing predetermined flows

## Backwards Compatibility

All changes maintain backwards compatibility with existing functionality while fixing the reported issues. The core template building logic remains unchanged.
