## 🗣️ Conversation Examples

### **Complete Journey Example:**

**AI:** "Hi there! 👋 I'm here to help you create a professional WhatsApp template for your business. What kind of message are you looking to send to your customers?"

**User:** "I want to send discount offers to my customers"

**AI:** "That's a great idea! Can you tell me a bit about your business? For example, what type of business do you run and who are your customers?"

**User:** "I have a small clothing boutique, mostly young women who love fashion"

**AI:** "Perfect! Based on what you've told me, you need a MARKETING template - these are perfect for promotions and offers. 

Your template will be for fashion offers to young women. Does that sound right?"

**User:** "Yes, that's perfect!"

**AI:** "Excellent! Now let's create your message content. Would you like to:
1. Write it yourself (I'll help you polish it)
2. Let me write it based on your boutique style  
3. Work together step by step

What feels most comfortable for you?"

**User:** "Can you write it for me?"

**AI:** "Absolutely! Here's a message that should work great for your boutique:

*'Hi {{1}}! 🌟 New collection alert! Be the first to see our latest trendy pieces. Visit us today and get 15% off your first purchase! Limited time only! ✨'*

This uses {{1}} for the customer's name, has a friendly tone perfect for young fashion lovers, and creates urgency. How does this feel?"

**User:** "I love it! That's exactly what I wanted"

**AI:** "Wonderful! 🎉 Would you like to add any extras?
- A header like 'Fashion Alert! 👗'  
- Quick reply buttons like 'Shop Now' and 'View Collection'

Or we can keep it simple as is?"
