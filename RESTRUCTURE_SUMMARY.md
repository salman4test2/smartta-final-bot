# WhatsApp Template Builder - Main.py Restructuring Summary

## Overview
Successfully restructured main.py to keep only critical endpoints and moved non-critical endpoints to dedicated route files for better organization and maintainability.

## Changes Made

### 1. Route Files Created/Updated

#### `app/routes/config.py` (NEW)
- `/health` - Health check endpoint
- `/config/reload` - Configuration reload endpoint

#### `app/routes/debug.py` (NEW) 
- `/session/{session_id}/debug` - Debug endpoint with LLM logs

#### `app/routes/users.py` (EXISTING - VERIFIED)
- `/users` POST - Create user
- `/users/login` POST - User authentication
- `/users/{user_id}/sessions` GET - Get user sessions
- `/users/{user_id}/sessions/{session_id}/name` PUT - Update session name

#### `app/routes/sessions.py` (EXISTING - VERIFIED)
- `/session/new` POST - Create session with name and user association

### 2. Main.py Critical Endpoints (KEPT)
- `/session/new` GET - Session initialization (backward compatibility)
- `/session/{session_id}` GET - Session data retrieval for UI
- `/chat` POST - Core chat functionality

### 3. Removed from Main.py
- Health and config endpoints → `config.py`
- Debug endpoints → `debug.py`  
- User management endpoints → `users.py` (already existed)
- Session creation POST → `sessions.py` (already existed)

### 4. Router Integration
- Added router imports in main.py
- Included all routers using `app.include_router()`
- Maintained helper function `_upsert_user_session()` in main.py (still needed by critical endpoints)

## Final Structure

### Main.py (Clean, Only Critical Endpoints)
```
- Startup configuration
- Helper functions for chat flow
- Critical endpoints:
  * GET /session/new
  * GET /session/{session_id}  
  * POST /chat
- _upsert_user_session helper
```

### Route Files (Organized by Function)
```
routes/
├── config.py    - System configuration endpoints
├── debug.py     - Debug and troubleshooting endpoints  
├── users.py     - User management endpoints
└── sessions.py  - Session lifecycle endpoints
```

## Verification
✅ All imports working correctly
✅ All endpoints accessible and responding
✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
✅ Proper separation of concerns
✅ Main.py is now clean and focused on core chat functionality

## Benefits
1. **Better Organization**: Related endpoints grouped in dedicated files
2. **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to find and modify specific functionality
3. **Cleaner Main File**: Focus on core chat functionality
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between different feature areas
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new endpoints in appropriate route files
