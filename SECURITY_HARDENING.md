# 🛡️ Security & Production Hardening Summary

## ✅ Completed Security Enhancements

### 🔐 Authentication & Password Security
- **Password Hashing**: Implemented BCrypt-based password hashing using `passlib`
  - New `app/auth.py` module with `hash_password()` and `verify_password()` functions
  - Updated user registration to hash passwords before storage
  - Updated user login to verify against hashed passwords
  - No more plaintext passwords in database

### 🌐 CORS Security Configuration
- **Environment-Based CORS**: Dynamic CORS configuration based on deployment environment
  - Development: `allow_origins=["*"]` for easy development
  - Staging: Restricted to localhost + staging domains  
  - Production: Only allows origins specified in `CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable
  - New `get_cors_origins()` function in `app/config.py`

### 🛡️ Input Sanitization & Data Protection
- **Sensitive Data Scrubbing**: Automatic redaction of emails and phone numbers
  - New `scrub_sensitive_data()` function in `app/utils.py`
  - Regex patterns for various email and phone number formats
  - Replaces sensitive data with `[EMAIL]` and `[PHONE]` placeholders
  - Integrated into user input sanitization pipeline

### 📋 Environment Configuration
- **Comprehensive Environment Setup**: New `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` guide
  - Clear documentation for development, staging, and production configurations
  - Environment variable documentation with examples
  - Security checklist for production deployment
  - Database setup instructions for PostgreSQL and SQLite

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Password Security
```python
# Before (insecure)
password=user_data.password  # Plaintext storage

# After (secure)
password=hash_password(user_data.password)  # BCrypt hashed

# Verification
verify_password(plain_password, hashed_password)  # Secure comparison
```

### CORS Configuration
```python
# Before (development-only)
allow_origins=["*"]  # Insecure for production

# After (environment-aware)
allow_origins=get_cors_origins()  # Dynamic based on ENVIRONMENT
```

### Data Scrubbing
```python
# Enhanced user input sanitization
text = scrub_sensitive_data(text)  # Remove emails/phones
# Existing protections for injection attacks remain
```

## 📚 New Dependencies
- `passlib[bcrypt]` - Secure password hashing library
- Updated `requirements.txt` with new dependency

## 🔄 Migration Notes
- **Existing Users**: Existing plaintext passwords will need migration or reset
- **Environment Variables**: New `ENVIRONMENT` and `CORS_ORIGINS` variables needed for production
- **Dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install new packages
